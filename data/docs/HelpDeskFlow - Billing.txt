4. Proration Rules (Deep Explanation)

4.1 When Proration Applies

Proration happens when customers:

add agents

remove agents

upgrade plan

downgrade plan

Formula:

Prorated amount = (Remaining days ÷ Total cycle days) × Charge difference

Example Scenario

Customer upgrades from Basic (£19) to Pro (£39) on day 10 of a 30-day cycle:

Remaining days = 20
Plan difference = £20

Prorated amount = (20/30) × 20 = £13.33

This is charged instantly.

4.2 Removing agents mid-cycle

Removing an agent does not issue an immediate refund

Instead, customer receives credit

Credit applies next invoice

Internal agents must check:

Billing → Team Member History

to ensure removal timestamp is correctly logged.
