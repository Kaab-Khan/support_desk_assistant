1. Introduction

This document explains the full workflow of using the HelpDeskFlow dashboard. Each section includes multi-step operational instructions, bullet points with deep explanations, and internal guidance on how features behave behind the scenes. The goal is to help users understand not just what to do, but how and why each step works.

2. Logging In & Dashboard Overview

2.1 Login Steps (Expanded)

Navigate to the dashboard URL and ensure you type it exactly (https://dashboard.helpdeskflow.com), because the system rejects logins attempted from secondary or cached subdomains to prevent phishing attacks.

Enter your email and password.

The system checks your password against a hashed value stored in secure storage and immediately rate-limits repeated failures to prevent brute-force attempts.

If two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled, enter the 6-digit code generated by your authenticator app.

The code expires every 30 seconds, so entering it too close to the expiry time may cause a failure and require you to enter a refreshed code.

Once authentication succeeds, the server generates a session token that is stored in secure HTTP-only cookies, which ensures the token cannot be accessed by scripts or extensions.

You are then redirected to the Ticket Inbox, which loads your most recent open tickets and begins pre-fetching your filters and saved views in the background.

Common Login Errors Explained

“401 Invalid Credentials” – this means the email exists but the password hash comparison failed, so the user must reset their password if they can’t recall it.

“403 Account Suspended” – this happens when your workspace billing is overdue beyond the allowed grace period or when your admin has manually suspended your account for security reasons.

Page loops back to login – usually caused by stale cookies or blocked third-party scripts; you must clear site storage and retry.

2.2 Dashboard Layout Explained

The dashboard has five essential navigation areas:

Inbox – This is where all active customer tickets appear. The system loads tickets in batches of 100 to keep performance optimal, and automatically caches recently viewed tickets for smoother navigation.

Customers – Displays detailed customer profiles. This includes ticket history, customer attributes, and sentiment metrics so agents can see a holistic view of the customer before responding.

Reports – Shows visualized metrics such as agent response time, ticket volume trends, and SLA compliance. The system generates these metrics using aggregated historical ticket logs.

Automation – Allows admins to define automation rules that control routing, tagging, SLA escalations, and auto-responses. These rules influence how tickets move through the system.

Settings – Contains workspace-specific configurations such as billing, user management, domain verification, and email routing settings.

3. Ticket Module (Deepened)

3.1 Viewing Tickets

A ticket includes multiple components, all of which serve a specific purpose:

Ticket ID – Assigned sequentially and acts as a unique reference key for internal searching and automation tracking.

Message Thread – Shows every incoming and outgoing message, giving full context of the issue.

Tags – Categorize tickets based on issue type so automation rules and reporting systems can interpret them.

Priority Level – Determines how quickly the ticket should be attended to and impacts SLA timers.

Assigned Agent – The person responsible for the ticket; this is critical because multiple automation rules rely on assignment metadata.

SLA Timer – Displays how much time is left before the SLA breach occurs. This timer automatically pauses if the ticket is set to Pending.

Internal Notes – Used for agent-to-agent communication; these notes are never shown to customers.

3.2 Creating a Ticket (Enhanced Explanation)

A. Manual Ticket Creation

Each step has a purpose:

Click “New Ticket” – This instructs the system to generate an empty ticket object in “Draft” mode before data is entered.

Enter customer information – Helps the system pull the correct customer profile and avoids duplicate account creation.

Choose an issue category – Categories impact routing rules and reporting metrics.

Add a subject & description – These form the ticket summary and are used for keyword detection in automation.

Attach files – Helps agents diagnose issues more accurately; attachments are scanned for viruses before being stored.

Assign priority – Enables SLA calculation based on internal thresholds.

Select agent or team – Determines who will handle the ticket; this field is referenced by most workflow rules.

Click “Create Ticket” – Moves the ticket from draft mode to active state and triggers relevant automation rules.

B. Email-to-Ticket Conversion Explained

Each inbound email goes through several technical checks:

The system first verifies SPF/DKIM to confirm the sender is legitimate.

It extracts the message content, sanitizes the HTML, and converts it to plain text for consistent formatting.

Attachments are scanned and stored.

The system checks whether similar tickets already exist and merges the email thread if applicable.

Auto-routing rules determine who should receive the ticket.

This multi-stage process ensures all emails become clean, structured tickets.

3.3 Responding to Tickets (Expanded)

Public Reply – Sends a message directly to the customer; the system logs the timestamp to track agent response time.

Internal Note – Useful for agent collaboration; never visible to the customer; internal notes are highlighted with a yellow background.

Email Response – Uses your integrated email; the system tracks deliverability and logs bounce errors.

Template Reply – Inserts pre-set responses that include dynamic tokens such as customer name or last order ID; templates ensure consistency across agents.

Behind-the-scenes behaviour

When an agent sends a public reply:

The system resets the “customer waiting” state.

SLA timers update automatically.

The thread is re-indexed for improved search accuracy.

4. Filters, Search & Querying (More Detail)

4.1 Quick Filters

Each quick filter applies preset logical conditions:

My Tickets – Filters by assigned agent = current user, ensuring agents only see tickets relevant to them.

Unassigned – Shows all tickets without an owner so team leads can distribute work.

SLA Breaching Soon – Highlights tickets where SLA is >70% consumed, helping agents prioritize urgent issues.

4.2 Search Behavior Explanation

Search supports boolean logic and field-specific queries.

Phrase search requires quotation marks to avoid partial matches.

Ticket fields are indexed in Elasticsearch-like format, so large queries remain fast.

Example:

Searching "payment failed" looks for the exact phrase, not individual words.

5. Customer Profiles (Deepened)

Each customer page contains:

Contact Details – Helps agents personalize communication.

Lifetime Ticket History – Helps identify patterns or recurring issues.

Customer Satisfaction Score – Calculated from recent CSAT responses; poor scores may trigger escalation rules.

Custom Fields – Allow businesses to add attributes like plan type, region, or customer value.

Cross-linking

Whenever a ticket is opened from a customer view:

The customer metadata is preloaded

Automation rules referencing customer tags become available

Recommended replies are adapted to customer history

6. Reports & Analytics (Deepened)

Every chart includes:

Raw data

Transformations (averages, medians, percent changes)

Colour-coded SLA compliance indicators

Time-range comparison logic (e.g., this week vs. last week)

Export behaviour

Large exports generate asynchronously:

A job is prepared

A background worker creates the file

A download link is emailed
This prevents dashboard slowdown.

7. Settings & Configuration (Detailed)

7.1 Email Routing Setup (More Details)

When setting up Gmail:

OAuth scopes allow reading incoming mail, but not manipulating other folders.

The system creates a shadow mailbox copy to avoid altering your original inbox.

When setting up Outlook:

IMAP access must be enabled by an admin.

The email is fetched every 60 seconds using a rolling sync process.

7.2 Workspace Security Settings

Admins can configure:

password strength rules

forced logout timers

allowed IP ranges

domain restrictions
These controls help prevent unauthorized access.

8. Common UI Errors Explained

Each error includes a cause and detailed resolution steps:

UI-001 React state mismatch – Happens when active session token expires; user must refresh the page completely so the client re-opens a fresh session.

UI-019 Timeout when loading tickets – Typically caused by a large ticket dataset; adjusting the date filter fixes it.

UI-028 Assignment errors – Occur when assigning tickets to agents who are marked offline; user must refresh agent status.

UI-045 Filter overload – Appears when combining incompatible filters; resetting the filter set resolves it
