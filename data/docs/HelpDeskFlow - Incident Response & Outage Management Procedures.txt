1. Introduction

This document provides a complete procedural framework for handling platform outages, service degradation, security incidents, integration failures, and customer-wide disruptions.
It outlines:

incident classification

communication protocols

diagnostics steps

internal and external SLAs

engineering escalation processes

root cause analysis (RCA) production

post-incident monitoring

status page updates and commitments

Each bullet is expanded into a multi-sentence explanation to ensure deep semantic richness for retrieval and reasoning.

2. Incident Classification Framework

2.1 P0 – Critical Global Outage

A P0 incident represents total or near-total system failure, where the entire HelpDeskFlow platform becomes unavailable to customers or where data corruption risks escalate rapidly.
This includes cases where ticket creation fails globally, inbound email conversion stops across all workspaces, login attempts fail systematically, or major infrastructure components (databases, load balancers, identity services) become unresponsive.

P0 incidents require immediate mobilisation of the Incident Commander (IC), SRE on-call, Engineering Lead, and Communications Lead, even if the event occurs outside working hours.
Response begins within 5 minutes due to contractual and operational commitments.

2.2 P1 – High-Severity Partial Outage

A P1 incident involves a major functional component failing for a significant subset of customers, such as routing automations breaking, webhooks failing, ticket updates timing out, or Slack notifications ceasing unexpectedly.
These incidents degrade primary workflows but do not prevent entire platform access.

P1 incidents trigger on-call SRE and the functional engineering team, but typically do not require immediate executive involvement unless customer impact spreads.

2.3 P2 – Moderate Degradation

A P2 issue involves intermittent or partial failures that impact specific features but allow users to continue operating, such as slow search indexing, attachment previews failing, or delayed SLA timers.
These issues affect usability but do not halt business operations.

P2 incidents follow normal working-hour escalation, unless they degrade rapidly into P1 or P0 scenarios.

2.4 P3 – Minor Service Issue

P3 issues involve cosmetic UI defects, performance fluctuations, or rare edge-case behaviours, such as filters not updating immediately or reports showing delayed data.
These incidents are logged and resolved in the normal sprint cycle.

3. Incident Lifecycle Overview

3.1 Detection → Triage → Containment → Resolution → RCA

Detection can occur through monitoring alerts, customer reports, automated anomaly detection, or internal manual observation.
A rapid acknowledgment window is crucial because delays often escalate the scope of the incident.

Triage involves determining severity, identifying the blast radius, and deciding whether the issue should be escalated to P0/P1.
The triage agent verifies whether the issue is global or isolated, checks logs, and reviews infrastructure metrics.

Containment aims to stop the incident from spreading or worsening**, such as disabling faulty automation rules, isolating regions, rolling back updates, or placing the system in read-only mode.

Resolution restores stable functionality**, either through rollback, patch deployment, component restart, capacity scaling, or infrastructure failover.

RCA documents what failed, why it failed, and what structural changes will prevent recurrence.
RCAs must be written within 72 hours.

4. Detection & Initial Assessment

4.1 Monitoring Alerts (Ultra-Deep Bullet)

HelpDeskFlow uses a multi-layer monitoring stack (Prometheus → Alertmanager → PagerDuty) to detect CPU spikes, failed API endpoints, database latency, message queue backlogs, and abnormal error rates.
When thresholds exceed predetermined levels, the system raises alerts that classify the type and possible cause of degradation.

Each alert includes historical trend comparisons, allowing SREs to determine whether a spike is a one-off event or part of a repeating pattern.
This distinction prevents false positives due to transient load or customer-specific spikes.

4.2 Customer Reports

Agents must always treat patterns of similar customer complaints as potential incidents, especially if they originate from different geographical regions or workspace types.
Customers often detect functional outages before monitoring systems catch them.

When multiple similar reports appear within a short window, agents must escalate immediately to SRE, even if monitoring has not yet triggered alerts.

5. Incident Command Structure

5.1 Roles & Responsibilities

Incident Commander (IC) – Owns decision-making, coordinates all teams, approves actions, maintains overall control, and ensures communication flows smoothly.
The IC is the single source of truth during the incident.

SRE On-Call – Performs direct infrastructure diagnostics, executes failovers, restarts services, examines error logs, and assists IC with technical risk assessment.

Engineering Lead – Leads root-cause analysis, directs developers to inspect code-level failures, and coordinates hotfix deployment.

Communications Lead – Writes Status Page updates, composes customer communications, and ensures tone and accuracy.
No one else communicates externally.

Support Liaison – Summarizes customer impact reports and fields real-time updates to agents so they can answer customer tickets consistently.

6. Immediate Containment Procedures

6.1 Database Outages

If database connectivity becomes unstable, SRE must immediately switch traffic to the secondary node, preventing widespread failures.
Databases operate under automatic failover, but manual intervention is sometimes required if replication lag rises excessively.

Active write operations must be temporarily suspended during failover, because writes made to a failing node may not replicate correctly.

6.2 API Gateway Failures

When API error rates spike, the gateway throttles traffic and temporarily shifts into protection mode, reducing load on downstream services.
This helps prevent cascading outages.

SRE must clear any faulty deployment that introduced the regression, often by rolling back to the last healthy version within minutes.

6.3 Automation or Webhook Failures

If automation rules or webhooks begin failing at scale, the system temporarily disables non-critical workflows, ensuring essential functions like ticket creation continue to work.

Queue backlog must be drained and replayed once the root cause is fixed, ensuring no lost events.

7. Communication Protocols

7.1 Internal Communication

All incident communication must happen in the dedicated “#incident-room” channel, preventing fragmented or contradictory commentary.
The IC maintains chronological updates that serve as the official record.

No side-channels or private messages may contain technical instructions, because this disrupts transparency.

7.2 External Communication

Only the Communications Lead may update the Status Page, ensuring consistency and compliance.
Updates include summary, scope, severity, affected regions, estimated resolution time, and workaround steps.

Support agents may respond to customers only using the sanctioned template, and must never speculate about causes or expected fix times unless approved.

8. Status Page Guidelines

8.1 When to Update

The status page must be updated for any P0 or P1 incident within 15 minutes of confirmation, or sooner if customers are already reporting outages.
Lack of communication increases customer frustration and leads to high ticket volume.

8.2 What to Include

Nature of outage

Affected users

Known symptoms

Acknowledgment of issue

Next update time

Workarounds (if any)

Every update must be factual, concise, and free from technical jargon.

9. Post-Incident Workflows

9.1 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

An RCA must be completed within 72 hours, including what happened, why it happened, how it was detected, how long it lasted, and what fixes are being implemented.
RCAs must include diagrams, logs, timelines, and a clear action list.

RCAs follow the “Five Whys” method, ensuring the analysis digs beyond surface-level explanations (e.g., “server crashed”) to uncover structural weaknesses (e.g., “memory leak introduced in release X caused resource exhaustion”).

9.2 Internal Debrief

The team conducts a post-incident meeting, where SRE, engineering, support, and product teams evaluate what went smoothly and what failed operationally.

Lessons learned are converted into concrete action items, not abstract recommendations.
For example: “Add replication lag alert” rather than “Improve database monitoring.”

9.3 Monitoring Enhancements

Any incident caused by insufficient monitoring must result in new alerts, dashboards, or automatic detection rules, ensuring the same issue triggers faster response next time.

10. Prevention & Continuous Improvement

10.1 Change Management

All high-risk deployments require staged rollouts, such as canary releases, to detect issues before global rollout.

Deployments on Fridays or immediately before holidays are disallowed, reducing the likelihood of extended off-hours incidents.

10.2 Chaos Testing

SRE performs quarterly “chaos drills” simulating failures (e.g., node shutdowns, network partitions) to ensure failover systems behave as expected.
