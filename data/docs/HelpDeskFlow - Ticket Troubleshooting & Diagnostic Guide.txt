1. Introduction

This document provides detailed procedures for diagnosing and resolving common issues customers face while using HelpDeskFlow. It is specifically created for support agents and includes:

step-by-step troubleshooting workflows

diagnostic paths

probable root causes

internal system behaviours

escalation rules

screenshot references (described textually)

error code mappings

The goal is to ensure agents deliver consistent and accurate technical support aligned with product behaviour.

2. Ticket Not Loading / Ticket Page Blank

2.1 Symptoms

Customers may report:

the ticket page showing a blank screen

the loading spinner never completing

partial ticket data appearing

errors like “Unable to load ticket” or code TCK-404

2.2 Root Causes & Explanations

Browser caching conflict – the browser may be storing outdated JavaScript files, causing the React application to fail during hydration.

Stale session token – expired or invalid session cookies prevent the server from authorizing the request.

Slow network or packet loss – incomplete responses from the API cause missing UI components.

Large ticket size – tickets with many attachments or long threads may exceed client rendering limits.

Filter mismatch – if the user applied incompatible filters, the ticket might be hidden or incompletely loaded.

2.3 Troubleshooting Steps

Perform a hard refresh (CTRL + SHIFT + R)

This forces the browser to bypass its cache and request fresh assets, resolving most ticket-rendering issues caused by cached scripts.

Clear domain-specific site data

Agents should guide customers to clear cookies and local storage only for HelpDeskFlow, ensuring session tokens and cached elements are rebuilt cleanly without impacting other websites.

Test in Incognito Mode

This removes all extensions and cached files. If the issue disappears in Incognito, an extension is blocking scripts or modifying requests.

Check the ticket ID directly through URL entry

If the direct URL works, the issue is likely related to filtering rules applied on the Inbox list, not the ticket itself.

Disable all browser extensions temporarily

Extensions like ad-blockers or privacy filters often interfere with API calls or block inline scripts essential for the UI.

Verify network stability

Ask the customer to run a speed test. Packet loss > 5% often causes intermittent loading issues.

Check ticket size

If the ticket includes >10MB of attachments or >200 messages, request engineering to generate a compressed version or archive prior messages.

Escalate if:

Ticket repeatedly fails to load even in a clean environment

API call returns 500-level errors

Ticket ID returns “not found” on authenticated API call

3. Email-to-Ticket Conversion Failing

3.1 Symptoms

Customer emails are not appearing as tickets

Attachments stripped from the email

Email stuck in “Processing Queue”

Repeated bounce notifications

3.2 Root Causes & Explanations

SPF/DKIM failure – sending domain did not pass email authentication.

Mailbox rate-limiting – company email provider is blocking forwarding due to send frequency.

Attachment size exceeding threshold – HelpDeskFlow enforces a per-email attachment limit of 25MB, and oversized attachments are dropped.

Auto-routing conflicts – two rules attempted to tag or assign simultaneously, causing the ticket creation process to halt.

Thread merging misfire – email thread was incorrectly merged with an older ticket based on subject similarity.

3.3 Troubleshooting Steps

Verify SPF/DKIM

Request customer to check DNS settings or provide the email headers.

Headers with “FAIL” under SPF or DKIM will be rejected by the system.

Inspect the Email Processing Queue

Navigate to Settings → Email Logs → Inbound Processing.

Find the email ID and check its status (QUEUED, FAILED, RETRYING, PROCESSED).

Check for Attachment Errors

In the email logs, attachment errors show as ATTACHMENT_TOO_LARGE or FILE_FORMAT_INVALID.

Review Automation Logs

Conflicting rules (e.g., one rule adding a tag, another removing it) can block ticket creation.

Search for Merged Threads

Use search format: subject:"<subject line>" OR email:"sender@domain.com"

Escalate if:

The queue shows “FAILED” for all emails from a specific domain

Email loops back with 550 errors

Attachments consistently corrupted

4. Slack Notifications Not Working

4.1 Symptoms

Slack messages fail to appear in the configured channel

Alerts from automation rules not triggering

Channel shows bot as offline or unresponsive

4.2 Root Causes

Slack integration token expired

Permissions revoked by Slack admin

Incorrect channel mapping

Slack API rate limits exceeded

Automation rule misconfiguration

4.3 Troubleshooting Steps

Check Integration Status

Go to Settings → Integrations → Slack

Verify whether the integration shows as “Connected,” “Expired Token,” or “Revoked Access.”

Re-authenticate Slack App

Click “Reconnect” to generate new OAuth token.

Verify Bot Permissions

Bot must have permission to:

read channels

post messages

send attachments

Check Channel Settings

Ensure bot was added manually to the desired Slack channel.

Check Rule Logic

Confirm the automation rule contains a valid Slack action.

5. Dashboard Performance Issues (Slow / Freezing)

5.1 Symptoms

Dashboard lags

Ticket list loads slowly

Spinning loader persists

Switching tabs freezes the interface

5.2 Root Causes & Explanations

Rendering overload – dashboard attempting to render very large data sets without pagination.

Corrupted local storage – invalid cached state causing React to repeatedly re-render.

Heavy browser extensions – interfering with scripts or blocking JS events.

Multiple browser tabs – simultaneous sessions exceed allowed concurrency and cause session token desync.

Legacy device/browser – older hardware struggles to run real-time UI updates.

5.3 Troubleshooting Steps

Check Ticket Volume

If the inbox contains >3,000 open tickets, the system may throttle UI rendering.

Narrow the date filter.

Clear Local Cache

In browser dev tools:
Storage → Clear Local Storage for domain → Refresh

Disable Extensions One-by-One

Privacy-focused extensions often block WebSocket connections.

Reduce Tab Count

HelpDeskFlow supports 3 active tabs; more tabs cause session key conflicts.

Switch to Lightweight View Mode

Admins can enable this under Workspace Settings → Advanced → Lightweight Mode

This disables animation-heavy components.

Escalate if:

Performance does not improve after lightweight mode

Logs show multiple WebSocket disconnects

Browser crashes or freezes repeatedly

6. Failed Exports (CSV / Excel)

6.1 Symptoms

Export stuck at “Preparing”

Export email never received

Export file corrupted

Export returns fewer records than expected

6.2 Root Causes

Export exceeds 50,000 record limit

Invalid date range

Underlying job worker stalled

Incorrect data encoding (UTF-8 mismatch)

Customer selected unsupported field combinations

6.3 Troubleshooting Steps

Check Export Limit

If the request exceeds the hardcoded 50,000 record limit, the export will fail silently.

Verify Date Range

Very large date ranges cause backpressure on job queues.

Check Export Logs

Under Reports → Export Logs, each export has a job ID showing its real-time status.

Attempt a Smaller Export

Use a narrower date range to test system behaviour.

Verify Email Delivery

If the export file is auto-emailed, check spam folder or domain filtering.

Escalate if:

Logs show EXPORT_WORKER_TIMEOUT

All exports fail across multiple workspaces

File arrives with partially missing rows

7. Incorrect Ticket Assignment (Auto-routing Issues)

7.1 Symptoms

Tickets assigned to wrong agent

Tickets bouncing between agents

Unassigned tickets piling up

Agents receiving irrelevant issue types

7.2 Root Causes

Multiple rules modifying assignment

Team availability schedules misconfigured

Skill-based routing tags missing

Agents marked as “Away” without system updating

Automation loop (rare, but possible)

7.3 Troubleshooting Steps

Check Automation Logs

Navigate to Automation → Logs

Look for rule IDs that triggered assignment.

Verify Team Settings

Ensure that the assigned team has at least one active member.

Check Agent Status

Agents marked as offline or on leave cannot receive tickets.

Inspect Ticket Tags

Missing or outdated tags affect skill-based routing.

Run “Simulate Rule”

Helps identify which rule should have triggered and why it didn’t.
